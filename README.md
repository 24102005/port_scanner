# port_scanner
This project is a simple Python-based port scanner. It allows users to scan a target host (either an IP address or domain name) for open TCP ports within a specified range. The scanner is interactive â€” when you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the target host, the starting port, and the ending port numbers.
