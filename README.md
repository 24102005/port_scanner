# port_scanner
This project is a simple Python-based port scanner. It allows users to scan a target host (either an IP address or domain name) for open TCP ports within a specified range. The scanner is interactive â€” when you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the target host, the starting port, and the ending port numbers.
The main features include:

User Input Driven: Enter the host and port range interactively when running the script.

Basic Scanning: Attempts to connect to each port to determine if it is open or closed.

Clear Output: Prints out a list of open ports as they are found.

Error Handling: Handles common errors such as hostname resolution failures and interrupted scans.

Note: This script is intended for educational purposes and should only be used to scan systems you own or have permission to test.
